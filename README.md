🌟 NeoCore AI update — Simple version that everyone can read

I finalised and organised the entire project properly. She added the missing pages, improved the existing modules, and made the whole thing clearer and cleaner. ✨

Then she updated the entire "legal" section to make it better explained and more understandable. ⚖️

Two new modules were also created:

NEOPEDIA 📚: a futuristic encyclopaedia that generates imaginary information from the future.

Medical advances 2030 → 2100 🧬: a simple timeline showing the evolution of medicine, decade by decade.

I also asked the AI to add several "personalities" so that it could respond differently depending on the tone: Cool 😎, Coach 💪, Friend 🤝, or Engineer 🤖 (but explained in a simple way).

Finally, everything was integrated and organised into the application, without it asking me each time if I really wanted it added. Everything is clean, clear, and works together. 🚀

🚀 NEOCORE AI – Version [2.8.6] – Major update

✨ Enhanced security and legality

The AI no longer provides medical or legal advice.

All regulated professions are now strictly excluded from generating responses.

Each response displays an automatic message:

⚠️ Speculative, educational content not intended for medical or legal use.

🔘 New GDPR button

Full compliance with European law.

Allows each user to manage their data easily.

♟️ Improved chess game

Strict adherence to the classic rules of chess.

It is no longer possible to move pieces randomly.

🗑️ Quick data deletion

A dedicated button allows you to instantly delete all your stored personal data.

💡 General improvements

Smoother and more intuitive interface.

Minor corrections to mini-games and interactive modules.

💜 Summary: NEOCORE AI is becoming even more secure, responsible and compliant with the law, while remaining a futuristic, interactive and fun hub.
